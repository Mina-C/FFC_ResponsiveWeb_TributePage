        ■ Biography
        <article>
         <p>Yuna Kim was born on September 5th, 1990 in Bucheon, Gyeonggi, South Korea. She began figure skating 
when she was 5 years old and was soon mesmerized by its charm.</p>
  <p>Yuna showed potential early on by winning numerous national competitions including 
the National Winter Sports Festival. She started to draw attention nationally as she became 
the youngest Korea skater to complete the 5 different triple jumps at the age of 11. 
She continued to show promise as she went on to win her first international competition, the Slovenia 
Triglav Trophy, in 2002 and the Croatia Golden Bear in 2003.</p>
  <p>Yuna Kim became a member of the Korean national team as soon as she entered middle school. 
She performed well at the competitions that she participated in during 2004 to 2006, winning several 
ISU Junior Grand Prix competitions and the 2006 Junior World Figure Skating Championships.

two gold medals in a row at the 2006-2007 season and 2007-2008 Grand Prix Finals. </p>
